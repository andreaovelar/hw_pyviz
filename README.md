In order to run the dashboard, we needed to define individual functions first that create the individual plots. 

The dashboard contains 6 tabs as follows 

* Population
  * You can zoom in and out to appreciate better the area of interest 
* Cost
  * Top 10 most expensive neighborhoods 
* Avg gross rent and sale
  * Contains Average gross rent and average sale prices - need to scroll to the right to see both plots (using row command)
* Neighborhood
  * Contains dropdown menu of the neighborhoods. Please select the desire neighborhood for analysis.
* Parallel plots 
  * Contains Parallel plots by category and coordinates - need to scroll down to see both plots (using column command)
* housing per year
  * Gross rent per year
